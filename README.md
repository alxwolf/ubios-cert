# Valid and free TLS / SSL certificates for UniFi Consoles V3.x and V2.x

Last update: December 13, 2023. 

*CAVEAT* there have been reports that v3.7.2 (early access) keeps overwriting custom certificates, breaking some applications. Currently under investigation.

## What it does

Spare you and your users from certificate errors when browsing to your UniFi Console's (Dream Machine Base / Pro / SE / R) administrative page, Guest Portal or RADIUS server.

**TL;DR** jump to [Installation](#installation)

It will install Neilpang's [`acme.sh`](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh), is extremely light as it runs on bare metal and survives (until further notice...) reboots and firmware upgrades (at least for minor revisions). No need fiddling around with `podman` installations.

With that, it will

* issue TLS (aka SSL) certificates for a domain (with Subject Alternate Names or wildcards) you own, using ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) (LE), and other [supported certification authorities](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh#supported-ca),
* use the DNS-01 challenge, so you don't have be present on the Internet with open ports 80 and 443,
* renew your certificate automatically every 60 days.

## Discontinued support for firmwares < v2.x

This branch serves the most current firmware(s). If you're still running a V1.x (why would you...), please have a look at branch [v1.x](https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/blob/V1.x/README.md) - which is no longer supported (at least not by me due to lack of hardware).

## Currently supported DNS API providers

Over 150, check [acme.sh DNS API](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi) Wiki for details.

## But why?

In most private installations, the UniFi console will live behind a router / firewall provided by an ISP, and we don't want to open HTTP(S) ports 80 and 443 to the interested public.

## What you need

* A UniFi Console with firmware V2.x or V3.x,
* a registered domain where you have API access for running the DNS-01 API challenge

## Installation

### Download the package

* `ssh` into your UDM
* Download the archive to your home directory
* Unzip it

  ```sh
  cd
  curl -L https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/archive/main.zip > ubios-cert.zip
  unzip ubios-cert.zip
  cd ubios-cert-main
  chmod +x deploy.sh
  ```

* [Make your adjustments](#make-your-adjustments) to `ubios-cert.env`
  
  ```sh
  vi ubios-cert/ubios-cert.env
  ```

* Deploy the files to their proper place

  ```sh
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

* Navigate to the deployment folder and issue your certificate for the first time

  ```sh
  cd /data/ubios-cert
  ./ubios-cert.sh initial
  ```

### Make your adjustments

Adjust file [`ubios-cert.env`](./ubios-cert/ubios-cert.env) to your needs.

First, define your certificate names and CA by adjusting

```sh
#######################################
# Configure certificates and provider #
#######################################

# The FQDN of your UniFi Console (comma separated fqdns and wildcards are supported)
CERT_HOSTS='domain.com,*.domain.com'

# Email address for registration
CA_REGISTRATION_EMAIL='user@domain.com'

# Default CA: https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/wiki/acme.sh:-choosing-the-default-CA
DEFAULT_CA="letsencrypt"
```

Second,

```sh
#################################################
# Select services to provide the certificate to #
#################################################

# Enable updating Captive Portal (for Guest Hotspot and WiFiman) certificate as well as device certificate
ENABLE_CAPTIVE='no'

# you want to spare users from "intermediate certificate missing" errors?
# this will break WiFiman iOS app
# uncomment next line, set to 'yes' to provide the full chain to Captive Portal
CAPTIVE_FULLCHAIN='yes'

# Enable updating Radius support
ENABLE_RADIUS='no'
```

Third, select your DNS API provider by adjusting the variable `DNS_API_PROVIDER="dns_xxx"`.

`dns_xxx` must be replaced with the `--dns` parameter from your provider's [acme.sh DNS API](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi) Wiki entry.

So for CloudFlare this would say

```sh
export DNS_API_PROVIDER="dns_cf"
```

Some APIs may require additional manual preparation, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/wiki).

Advanced: you can pass additional command line options to `acme.sh` by editing environment variable `ACMESH_CMD_PARAMS`.

## First Run

Consider making a backup copy of your [current certificate and key](https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/wiki/Certificate-locations-on-UDM(P)) before moving on.

```sh
mkdir /data/ubios-cert/certbackup
cd /data/ubios-cert/certbackup
cp /data/unifi-core/config/unifi-core.key ./unifi-core.key_orig
cp /data/unifi-core/config/unifi-core.crt ./unifi-core.crt_orig
cp /data/udapi-config/raddb/certs/server.pem ./raddb-server.pem
cp /data/udapi-config/raddb/certs/server-key.pem ./raddb-server-key.pem
```

Calling the script with `sh /data/ubios-cert/ubios-cert.sh initial` will

* setup up the trigger for persistence over reboot / firmware upgrades
* establish a cron job to take care about your certificate renewals
* register an account with your email
* issue a certificate (with SANs, if you like)
* deploy the certificate to your network controller (and captive portal, if you selected that)
* restart the unifi-os

## Certificate Renewal

Should be fully automated, done via a daily `cron` job. You can trigger a manual renewal by running `sh /data/ubios-cert/ubios-cert.sh renew`, which may be useful for debugging. If `acme.sh` fails, check if you hit the [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).

The certificate can be force-renewed by running `sh /data/ubios-cert/ubios-cert.sh forcerenew`.

## Behaviour after firmware upgrade / reboot

Survived reboots and firmware updates, including release change from V2 to V3.

## De-installation and de-registration

`ssh` into your UDM. Calling the script with parameter `cleanup` will

* Remove the cron file from `/etc/cron.d`
* Remove the (most recently issued) domains from the Let's Encrypt account
* De-activate the Let's Encrypt account

Then, you can delete the script directory. As always, be careful with `rm`.

```sh
cd /data/
./ubios-cert/ubios-cert.sh cleanup
rm -irf ./ubios-cert
```

## Selecting the default CA

`acme.sh` can access different CAs. [You can select which CA you want it to use](https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert/wiki/acme.sh:-choosing-the-default-CA). The keywords are listed [here](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Server). Adjust the value in `ubios-cert.env` first and then call the script with `ubios-cert.sh setdefaultca`. This CA will **from now on** be applied to newly issued certificates.

## Debugging

* Increase the log level in `ubios-cert.sh` by setting `LOGLEVEL="--log-level 2"`
* Run `tail -f ${DATA_DIR}/ubios-cert/acme.sh/acme.sh.log`in separate terminal while running `sh ubios-cert.sh initial`, `sh ubios-cert.sh renew` or `sh ubios-cert.sh bootrenew` manually

## Inspired by - Sources and Credits

A huge "Thank You" goes to

* [Neilpang's acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh): the probably most convenient and most supported interface for Let's Encrypt, ZeoSSL, Buypass and SSL.com.
* [llaforest](https://github.com/llaforest): for implementing the native / bare metal version of `acme.sh`
* [kchristensen's udm-le for UDM](https://github.com/kchristensen/udm-le): his work provides the base for both structure of implementation and content.

## Known bugs and unknowns

* For sure some, but no known.
